Hungarian language pack for the Kaleidoscope. This plugin introduces a number of
new key codes, which can be used to input Hungarian symbols on any operating
system that supports a `Compose` key. The package has been tested under GNOME
and Windows with WinCompose.

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, one needs to include the header, and add the new keycodes to
the keymap.

## Plugin symbols

The plugin provides the `Hungarian` object, and the following new keycodes:

### HUN_AA

> Short for "a acute". The keycode results in `á`, or `Á` when shifted.

### HUN_OA

> Short for "o acute". The keycode results in `ó`, or `Ó` when shifted.

### HUN_OU

> Short for "o umlaut". The keycode results in `ö`, or `Ö` when shifted.

### HUN_ODA

> Short for "o double-acute". The keycode results in `ő`, or `Ő` when shifted.
